**undb Version 1.0.0-61: Introducing Kanban View and Key UI Enhancements**

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce the release of **undb Version X.X**, bringing an array of exciting new features and important bug fixes to enhance your no-code experience. Whether you're managing data or building an application, this update improves both functionality and usability. Here's what's new in this version:

### üöÄ **Key Features**

#### 1. Kanban View
The highlight of this release is the **Kanban view**, which offers a more intuitive way to manage tasks, projects, and workflows. This view introduces several powerful features:
- **Drag-and-drop sorting**: Easily reorganize tasks or records by dragging them across lanes.
- **Create and delete options directly**: You can now add or remove options within the Kanban view without switching to other interfaces.
- **Paginated lane loading**: For larger datasets, lanes can now load in pages, ensuring smooth performance even with extensive records.

#### 2. UI Enhancements for Views
We‚Äôve refined the experience around views in undb:
- **Updated UI for updating and copying views**: It‚Äôs now easier and faster to modify and duplicate views, thanks to our redesigned user interface.
- **Improved form management**: The ability to **delete forms** has been introduced, giving you more control over your form configurations.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Bug Fixes**

- **No more duplicate names**: We‚Äôve squashed the bug that allowed duplicate names across tables and fields, ensuring better data integrity.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Performance and Usability Improvements**

In addition to the new Kanban features and UI updates, we‚Äôve made several performance improvements that make undb more efficient to use, even for complex projects.
